# demo-project:Plant Genesis
This project demonstrates the skills I gain during Resilient Coders 2020A bootcamp. 

This is a web application displaying real time data of the tempurture and humidity. 


# How It's Made

**Tech used**: 
 - **Software:** HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB, Passport, Express.js, Socket.io
 
  - **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B), DHT11 Temperature + Humidity sensor
  
 

# Updates

- **3/29/2020:** Was able to install node.js, and the dhtll senor libary on RPI and read the sensors values and onthe console. Also drafted out how the website, database, and device will connect to one another.
